Concepts:
1) Subqueries : A subquery is a query inside another query. They’re also called nested queries.
They can be placed in:
the WHERE clause
the FROM clause
the SELECT clause

2) Types of Subqueries:
| Type           | Returns                | Example                                                               | Used In       |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Scalar**     | Single value           | `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM Employee)`                                  | WHERE, SELECT |
| **Multi-row**  | Multiple values        | `(SELECT department_id FROM Department)`                              | IN, ANY, ALL  |
| **Correlated** | Depends on outer query | `(SELECT MAX(salary) FROM Employee e2 WHERE e2.dept_id = e1.dept_id)` | WHERE         |

1) in -> atleast one value.
2) exists -> returns atleast one row -> a boolean check.
3) any -> greater than any value in the list.
4) all -> compares to all the values.
